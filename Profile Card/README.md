## Build with
- HTML
- CSS

## Description of HTML

This is an HTML code that creates a profile card. 
The code consists of a header section that defines the document type, character set, and viewport settings. 
It also sets the title of the page and links to an external CSS file. <br/>

The main content of the code is wrapped in a `div` element with the class name `card-wrapper`. This is the container for the entire profile card.

## What I learned
Through building this profile card, I was able to gain more experience with HTML and CSS, particularly with creating responsive designs.
 I also learned how to use flexbox and media queries to adjust the layout of the profile card based on screen size. <br/>

 Inside the `card-wrapper` div, there are two sections that define the different parts of the profile card. 
 The first section is `card-name-wrapper` which includes the `user's name`, `age`, `location`, and an `image`. 
 The second section is `card-insights`  which displays the user's `followers`, `likes`, and `photos`. <br/>

The profile card is designed using CSS, and the styles are defined in an external stylesheet file linked in the head section of the HTML file. <br/>

The HTML code uses various elements such as div, h4, p, img, and span to structure and format the content. <br/>

## Continued Development
In the future, I would like to add more features to the profile card, such as the ability to update likes in real time.
 I also want to continue exploring different CSS frameworks and libraries to enhance the design and functionality of the profile card.
